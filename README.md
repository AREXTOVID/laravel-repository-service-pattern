## Introduction

This repository serves as a practical guide for developers who want to understand and implement Clean Architecture using Laravel. The focus is on the Repository and Service patterns, which help in organizing code for better maintainability and testability.

By following this guide, you will learn how to structure your Laravel applications effectively, making them easier to manage and extend.

## Features

- Step-by-step implementation of CRUD operations.
- Clear separation of concerns using design patterns.
- Easy-to-follow code examples.
- Emphasis on SOLID principles.
- Real-world application of best practices in Laravel.

## Technologies Used

- **PHP**: The primary programming language.
- **Laravel**: The PHP framework used for building the application.
- **MySQL**: The database used for data storage.
- **Composer**: Dependency management for PHP.
- **Git**: Version control system.

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AREXTOVID/laravel-repository-service-pattern.git
cd laravel-repository-service-pattern
composer install
```

Make sure to set up your `.env` file for database configuration. You can copy the example file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then run the following command to generate an application key:

```bash
php artisan key:generate
```

Finally, run the migrations to set up the database:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

## Usage

To run the application, use the following command:

```bash
php artisan serve
```

Visit `http://localhost:8000` in your web browser to access the application.

## Design Patterns Explained

### Repository Pattern

The Repository pattern abstracts data access, allowing for a cleaner separation between the data layer and business logic. This means you can easily swap out the data source without affecting the rest of your application.

### Service Layer

The Service layer encapsulates business logic. It acts as a bridge between the controllers and repositories, keeping the controllers thin and focused on handling requests.

### Interface

Using interfaces allows you to define contracts for your repositories and services. This promotes loose coupling and makes it easier to swap implementations.

## Best Practices

- **Follow SOLID Principles**: This will help you write more maintainable and testable code.
- **Keep Controllers Thin**: Move business logic to services.
- **Use Dependency Injection**: This makes your code more flexible and easier to test.
- **Write Tests**: Ensure your application works as expected by writing unit and integration tests.
